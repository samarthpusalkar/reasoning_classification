Okay, I can help you with creating a text dataset for classification focusing on reasoning, self-questioning/self-awareness, and providing a potential scoring method.  Building this dataset will be a multi-step process, and it's crucial to define these categories clearly.

Let's break down the request and then outline how to create this dataset:

Understanding the Categories:

Reasoning: Text that demonstrates logical thought, argumentation, drawing conclusions from premises, providing evidence, or explaining causality. This is about the process of thinking and justification.
Self-Questioning and Self-Awareness: Text that shows introspection, examination of one's own beliefs, doubts, assumptions, understanding of one's own emotions, thoughts, and limitations. This category is about metacognition and understanding oneself in relation to the world and one's own thinking processes.
Not (Reasoning, Self-Questioning, Self-Aware): Text that lacks these qualities. This might include:
Descriptive text: Simply stating facts without analysis.
Narrative text (mostly): Telling a story without deep reflection or logical argument (though stories can contain reasoning and self-awareness, so context is key).
Command or imperative text: Instructions or orders.
Exclamatory or purely emotional text: Expressing feelings without introspection or reasoned thought.
Generic opinions without justification: Stating a belief without providing reasons or self-reflection.
Scoring (Optional, but highly valuable):

A score can add nuance. Instead of just classifying, you could assess the degree to which each category is present in a piece of text.  This could be on a scale, for example:

0: Not present at all.
1: Weakly present, minimal indication.
2: Moderately present, noticeable elements but not dominant.
3: Strongly present, a central characteristic of the text.
You could have separate scores for "Reasoning" and "Self-Questioning/Self-Awareness".  Or, if you want a single score, you might have to combine them or prioritize one.

Creating the Dataset - Steps and Suggestions:

Here's a structured approach to build your dataset:

1. Source Material Selection:

You need to gather text from diverse sources that are likely to contain varying degrees of reasoning and self-questioning. Here are some ideas:

Philosophical Texts: (High in Reasoning and Self-Questioning)
Examples: Plato's Dialogues, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Kant's Critiques, Sartre's Existentialism is a Humanism.
Why: These texts are explicitly concerned with logical argumentation, exploring ideas, and often questioning assumptions about the world and the self.
Psychology and Cognitive Science Texts (Especially on Metacognition): (High in Reasoning and Self-Questioning, often in a more scientific mode)
Examples: Papers and books on metacognition, decision-making, cognitive biases, consciousness.
Why: These texts analyze thinking processes and self-awareness directly.
Existential Literature (Fiction and Non-fiction): (Medium to High in Self-Questioning, can have Reasoning)
Examples: Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground.
Why: These often explore themes of meaning, purpose, identity, and individual consciousness, leading to self-reflection and sometimes philosophical reasoning.
Personal Essays and Reflective Blog Posts: (Variable, can be High in Self-Questioning, sometimes Reasoning)
Examples: Essays from collections like "The Situation and the Story" (essays on creative nonfiction), thoughtful blog posts from platforms like Medium or personal websites.
Why: Essays often involve personal reflection and exploration of ideas. Blog posts, depending on the author and topic, can also exhibit these qualities.
Debate Transcripts or Argumentative Articles/Op-Eds: (High in Reasoning, Lower in Self-Questioning, unless reflecting on their own arguments)
Examples: Transcripts of formal debates, well-argued opinion pieces from reputable news sources or journals.
Why: Focus on presenting arguments and reasoning to persuade.
Reddit/Forums (Carefully Selected Subreddits): (Highly Variable, can find examples of all categories, but need careful filtering)
Examples: Subreddits like r/philosophy, r/changemyview (for argumentation and challenging beliefs), r/intp (personality type often associated with introspection).
Caution: Quality varies wildly. You'd need to curate and filter heavily.
News Articles (Mostly "Not" category, but can contain reasoning in analysis sections):
Examples: Straight news reports, editorials, analytical pieces.
Why: News reporting itself is often factual and descriptive ("Not" category). Editorials and analysis may contain reasoning.
Social Media Posts (Generally "Not" category unless very specific types):
Examples: Tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram captions.
Why: Usually short, informal, and focused on immediate communication, less likely to be deeply reasoned or self-reflective in their typical form. Exceptions exist.
Instruction Manuals, Recipes, Procedural Text: (Mostly "Not" category, descriptive or imperative).
Why: Focus on giving instructions, not on reasoning or self-reflection.
2. Text Segmentation:

Decide on the unit of text you'll classify. Sentences might be too granular. Paragraphs or short passages (e.g., 3-5 sentences) are often better for capturing context and demonstrating reasoning or self-reflection.
Break down your source texts into these segments.
3. Annotation/Labeling Process:

Define Clear Annotation Guidelines:  This is critical.  Provide your annotators with:

Clear definitions of "Reasoning," "Self-Questioning/Self-Awareness," and "Not." Use examples to illustrate each category. (The examples I gave above are a starting point).
Scoring guidelines (if using): Explain the 0-3 (or whatever scale you choose) and what each score level means for each category.
Examples of texts that fall into each category with scores.
Guidelines for ambiguous cases: What to do when a text segment is borderline or seems to fit multiple categories partially.
Choose Annotators: You'll need human annotators to read the text segments and apply the labels and scores. Consider:

Expert Annotators: If you need very nuanced judgments, experts in philosophy, psychology, or literature might be valuable (but more costly).
Trained Annotators: Train people specifically on your definitions and guidelines. Ensure inter-annotator agreement (see next point).
Crowdsourcing (with caution): Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk can be used, but you must have very clear guidelines and strong quality control mechanisms, including inter-annotator agreement checks and gold standard examples.
Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA):

Crucial for Dataset Quality: Have multiple annotators label the same set of text segments. Calculate IAA metrics (e.g., Cohen's Kappa, Fleiss' Kappa for multi-annotator).
Aim for Good Agreement: Moderate to substantial agreement is generally desired. If IAA is low, you need to refine your guidelines and possibly train annotators further. Disagreements highlight ambiguity in your categories or guidelines.
Annotation Format:  Decide how you'll store the annotations.  A simple format could be:

Code snippet
text_segment,reasoning_category,self_questioning_category,not_category,reasoning_score,self_questioning_score
"Example text segment 1",0,1,0,1,2
"Example text segment 2",1,0,0,3,0
"Example text segment 3",0,0,1,0,0
...
 (If you are using scores and category labels simultaneously, or just scores, adjust accordingly).

4. Dataset Creation & Splitting:

Compile Annotated Data: Gather all the annotated text segments into a single dataset file (CSV, JSON, etc.).
Data Cleaning & Review: Review the dataset for any inconsistencies, errors, or segments that were poorly annotated (based on IAA and individual annotations). You may need to re-annotate or discard some data.
Dataset Splitting: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split is 70-80% training, 10-15% validation, 10-15% test. Ensure you have a representative distribution of categories and scores in each split.
5. Dataset Documentation:

Create a Dataset Card: Document everything about your dataset:
Sources of text data.
Annotation guidelines used.
Annotation process.
Inter-annotator agreement metrics.
Dataset statistics (category distribution, score distributions).
Intended use of the dataset.
Potential limitations and biases.
Example Dataset Snippets (Illustrative and Hypothetical):

Let's imagine some example text segments and how they might be classified and scored (using a 0-3 scale for scores, and categories as binary for simplicity in this example):

Text Segment	Reasoning Category (Binary)	Self-Questioning Category (Binary)	Reasoning Score (0-3)	Self-Questioning Score (0-3)
"The sky is blue."	0	0	0	0
"Go get the mail, please."	0	0	0	0
"I feel so angry right now!"	0	0	0	0
"Therefore, based on the evidence presented, we can conclude that X is likely."	1	0	3	0
"I wonder if my initial assumption about this problem was actually correct."	0	1	0	3
"While some argue A, it's important to consider the counter-argument B, because..."	1	0	2	0
"Reflecting on my past actions, I realize I could have handled that situation better."	0	1	0	2
"Thus, if all premises are true and the argument is valid, the conclusion must follow."	1	0	3	0
"Is it possible that my own biases are influencing how I'm interpreting this data?"	0	1	0	3
"Although it appears X initially, a deeper analysis reveals a more complex picture."	1	0	2	0
"Upon further introspection, I'm starting to question my long-held belief about Y."	0	1	0	3
Key Considerations and Challenges:

Subjectivity: Classifying these categories, especially self-questioning/self-awareness, can be subjective. Clear guidelines and inter-annotator agreement are essential to mitigate this.
Context Dependency: The same phrase can have different meanings in different contexts. Consider providing enough context to your annotators.
Ambiguity: Some texts may exhibit traits of multiple categories or be borderline. Your guidelines need to address how to handle ambiguity.
Dataset Size: A reasonably sized dataset is needed to train a good classification model. The effort involved in annotation can be significant.
Ethical Considerations: If you are using data from online sources (e.g., Reddit, blogs), be mindful of privacy and terms of service. For research purposes, using publicly available philosophical or literary works might be more ethically straightforward initially.
Next Steps after Dataset Creation:

Once you have your dataset, you can use it to:

Train Machine Learning Models: Train classifiers (e.g., using models like BERT, RoBERTa, or simpler models like Naive Bayes, SVM with appropriate features) to automatically classify text segments into your categories and/or predict scores.
Evaluate Model Performance: Use your validation and test sets to evaluate how well your trained models perform (metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, correlation for scores).
Iterate and Improve: Based on model performance and dataset analysis, you may need to refine your categories, improve your annotation guidelines, or collect more data to enhance your dataset and models.
Creating this dataset will be a significant undertaking, but it's a fascinating and valuable task for understanding and classifying different aspects of human thought expressed in text. Good luck!
